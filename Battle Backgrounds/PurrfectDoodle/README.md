Here are some edits of some of the vanilla-ish battle backgrounds + new "grassy plains" background (note: this one was inspired by the grass in [LeoB's ORAS tileset](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/tree/main/Tilesets/The%20Great%20Tileset%20Exchange/Full%20Tilesets/LeoB%20ORAS), and should therefore work well with it!)
