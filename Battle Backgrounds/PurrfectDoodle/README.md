I edited the vanilla-ish **water** and **pond water** battle backgrounds, and I created a whole new **"grassy plains"** background (note: this one was inspired by the grass in [LeoB's ORAS tileset](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/tree/main/Tilesets/The%20Great%20Tileset%20Exchange/Full%20Tilesets/LeoB%20ORAS), and should therefore work well with it!).
