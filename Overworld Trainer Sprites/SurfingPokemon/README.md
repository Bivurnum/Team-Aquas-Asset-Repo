# Surfing OW Sprites
Based on: https://github.com/Shiny-Miner/dynamic_surf_ows_masters-expansion

The player is placed on top of the surf OW sprite, using our C-injection repository linked above.

Originally intended for use with Fire Red

## Example:
![Surfing Pikachu](example.gif)

**Please note that some Dynamic Surf OW use 64x64 instead of 32x32 sprites**

## Edge Case
![Kingler](kingler.gif)

Some Pokemon may support a unique east/west (left/right) facing sprite!
Kingler has asymmetrical claws, so in order to keep it biologically accurate, our project added support!

This will mean its sprite differs from the other sprites included in this folder.
