# Surfing OW Sprites
Based on: https://github.com/Shiny-Miner/dynamic_surf_ows_masters-expansion

The player is placed on top of the surf OW sprite, using our C-injection repository linked above.

Originally intended for use with Fire Red

## Example:
![Surfing Pikachu](example.gif)

**Please note that some Dynamic Surf OW use 64x64 instead of 32x32 sprites**
