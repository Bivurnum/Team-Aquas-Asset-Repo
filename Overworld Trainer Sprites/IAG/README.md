## IAG's Assorted OW Trainer Sprites

All sprites use the RSE style (facing towards the camera rather than forwards on the perspective plane) so should fit right in in most Hoenn hacks.

As indexed PNGs, they can be dropped directly into pokeemerald-expansion and work flawlessly out of the box; no need for a `.pal` file.

If you use any of these sprites, please credit IAG.
