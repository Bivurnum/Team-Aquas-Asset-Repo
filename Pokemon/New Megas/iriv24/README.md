I got permission from all the artists who worked on these to share them once my project was released, so you are free to use them however you want and make edits to them as desired! 

Please just be sure to credit the original artist appropriately if you use one of them! I dont need to be credited if you use one, but if you dont credit the artist we will have beef :gunpossum:
